# Gander_Take_Home_Project

Dependencies:
- npm install

Tech Stack:
- Next.js 
- Tailwind CSS
- React useState / useEffect
- localStorage

I spent about an hour on fulfilling all the requirements stated in the project description and then about another 30 minutes working on some styling. 

A few things to note:
- At the moment the project just uses some mock data (located in mock_data/aircraft.js) and isn't connected to a backend. However, I did add the ability for users to add more planes which is handeled locally using localStorage
- I did not deploy on Vercel and it can just be ran locally
